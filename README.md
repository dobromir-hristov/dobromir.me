# Hi. I am Dobromir Hristov

And this is my personal website's repo

I am a front-end developer and I love working with Vue.js.

### About this website
The website is built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and is deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

The downloadable CV pdf is generated by Puppeteer from the Vue markup on each deploy, 
ensuring always up to date document. 

To see how I do that, please take a look at the `functions` folder.
